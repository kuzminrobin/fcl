  ```rs
          g(i: 6) {}
        } // f().
      } // Loop body end.
      // Loop body repeats 2 time(s).   // MUST BE 1.

        f(i: 8) {
          g(i: 8) {
  Sample stderr output in main()
  ```
  Suspicion:
  Upon end of the repeated loop body the node is removed from the tree 
  and the previous node's overall repeat count gets incremented.  
  But if that repeated loop body caching has stopped earlier (because of thread switching or std output) 
  then the flushed repeat count should also increment. Otherwise later there will be 1 extra non-flushed repeat logged.  
  In other words, if upon repeated loop body end the caching is not active,
  then both the overall and flushed repeat counts need to be incremented.
* User practice: For speed, suppress the logging of 
  * parameters and ret val;
  * generic params.
* Minimization Guide
  * If the implementation is single-threaded and no need to sync with std output (and panic) 
    then the CallLoggerArbiter is not needed and the THREAD_LOGGER can be directly pointing 
    to the CallLogInfra (after the type adjustment). Reflect on the chart 
    and in the "The Minimal Writer Optimization" chapter of the mdBook.
  * 
* In the docs replace all the `std::io::stdio::stdout()` with the `std::io::stdout()`.
* Writer opening and closing (to open/close HTML).
* Why does every thread have a separate Decorator and WriterAdapter? Access to them is exclusive any way.
  Explain that both in the code and in the docs.
  Answer: for decorating different threads with different colors with an HTML writer (or to different writers). Document that.
* Convert every occurrence to either "stdout and/or stderr" or "stdoutput" or "std output".
* In .md break-up long lines to short ones.
* Pseudonode (TODO: Consider -> pseudoroot)
* Implement endless logging (see "mdBook.md").
* Double-check the case of a thread switch immediately after the repeat count increment,
  i.e. there is a non-flushed repeat count that needs to be flushed before the next thread's logging.
* Double-check all the doc comments with ChatGPT.

  When FCL can be useful. 
  I was using similar functionality in hardware simulation. Combined with the virtual hardware log (showing which value has been written to or read from a hardware register) I was able to evaluate the behavior, quickly identify the fragment of interest, turn more verbose logging for virtual hardware during that fragment, and figure out the issue. In a number of cases it let me avoid debugging.
  In that project I was using a very similar call graph and logging part. But it was implemented in C. During firmware execution on a virtual hardware the virtual CPU was catching the function call and return machine instructions (including the interrupts) and was triggering the calls to update the call graph and log.
  If you are using something like OpenOCD for your own hardware bring-up (not necessarily in Rust), you can reuse at least the call graph and logging part for a function call logging feature of your toolset.
* (Unsorted)
  Add to documentation.
  The single mutex can significantly distort the thread constext switch picture. E.g. one thread locks the mutex and starts updating the call graph. The thread context switches to a different thread. The other thread makes a call and tries to lock the mutex to log that call, and starts waiting for the mutex, returning the context back to the one owning the mutex. The mutext owner releases the mutex and then can log a few calls more, and again get interrupted while the mutex is locked. This can happen a number of times.
  To summarize, the log can show that the thread switch happened later and with one attempt,
  but in reality there could be a number of imperfect attempts to switch the thread ctx earlier than what the log shows.
  The user should know details about how the thread switch picture gets tistorted.
  How large is the distortion? Depends on the code. If there are lengthy fragments without loops and calls, then the distortion is minimal. But the more often the code execution passes through the loop, function, and closure starts and ends the larger is the distortion (and the slow-down because of logging).
* (Unsorted. Consider) When the overall repeat count reaches MAX, flush the call and clear both the overall and flushed repeat count.
* (Not completed) Consider moving the thread_local use deeper into the call.
  Such that a {Call|Closure}Logger is created unconditionally.

# Making Functions Loggable
Functions can be marked as loggable with the [`proc_macro_attribute` macro](https://veykril.github.io/tlborm/proc-macros/methodical/attr.html).

Further function instrumenting can be done with the [Third-Party Crates](https://veykril.github.io/tlborm/proc-macros/third-party-crates.html).

TODO:


# Call Graph
Theoretically the call graph shoudl be a tree, where the root is `main()`.
But if the logging is enabled after the `main()` started,
then the subsequent function calls do not form a tree but a sequence of subtrees of `main()`.
E.g., actual calls:
```c++
main() {
    // Call logging gets enabled here.
    f() {
        g() {}
    }
    h() {}
}
```
The information the call graph collects (after the logging gets enabled):
```c++
f() {
    g() {}
}
h() {}
```
This infomation is not a tree but is a sequence of subtrees `[f(), h()]`.
To unify the functionality, the code turns the call graph to a tree
by initializing the graph with a pseudo-node that will serve as a call tree root,
and the subsequent calls `f()`, `h()`, and on will be added as nested calls (children) to that pseudo-node.
The actual information stored in the call graph will be
```c++
pseudo_node {
    f() {
        g() {}
    }
    h() {}
}
```
The pseudo-node will stay at the bottom of the call stack until the call graph destruction.

# Call Stack
The call stack is intended 
* for an efficient return to the parent of the current node in the call tree
* while keeping the call tree singly linked (the links point from the root towards the leaves, but not vice versa).

The following diagrams provide an example.
```c++
// Actual calls
main() {
    // Call logging gets enabled here.
    f() {
        // TODO: Document the log if logging gets enabled here ("g() {} <Return from f() is ignored> h() { i() {} }").
        g() {}
    }
    h() {
        i() {}
    }
}
```
```
Moment | The information after that moment, contained
       |---------------------------------------------------------------
       | in the call graph   | in the call stack (p is the pseudo-node)
========================================================================
     0 | f() {               | [p, f]
     1 |     g() {           | [p, f, g]
     2 |          }          | [p, f]
     3 | }                   | [p]
     4 | h() {               | [p, h]
     5 |     i() {           | [p, h, i]
     6 |          }          | [p, h]
     7 | }                   | [p]
```

# Call Caching
TODO: What caching is.

## Caching Start Detection
Caching start is detected upon call only, when the name of the current call (name of a new child of the current parent)
repeats the name of the previous call (name of the previous child of the current parent). In this case the previous call
becomes the model for caching (`caching_model`) and the current call, including its nested calls, 
starts being cached instead of being logged. E.g.
```c++
// Data
parent() {
    ...
    child() {}                                  // 2. Becomes the caching model (caching_model = Some(&<this child>)). 
    child() { // 1. The call being handled.     // 3. Start caching this child (and nested calls) instead of logging.
}
```
Another example.
```c++
// Data
parent() {
    ...
    child() {                                   // 2. Becomes the caching model (caching_model = Some(&<this child>)). 
        ...
        nested_call() {
            ...
            more_nested_call() {}
            ...
        }
        ...
    }
    child() { // 1. The call being handled.     // 3. Start caching this child (and nested calls) instead of logging.
}
```

If caching start is not detected (no previous child, or 
the called function's name differes from the previous child's name) 
then, if the previous child is present and its repeat count is non-zero, flush the previous child's repeat count.
E.g.
```c++
// Data
parent() {
    ...
    previous_child() { /* Optional nested calls */ }
    // previous_child repeats 99 time(s).           // 2. Log this.
    new_child() {   // 1. The call being handled.   // 3. Log this.
}
```
## Caching Continuation
If during caching another caching start is detected among the nested calls then caching continues.
The `caching_model` stays the same.
That is why during caching it makes no sense to try to detect the caching start.
```rust
// Rust Code
if !caching_model.is_some() { // If cahcing is not active,
    // try to detect the caching start.
}
```

## Caching End Detection
Caching end can only be detected upon return.
```
(Handling the Return)

If caching is not active {
    Log the repeat count, if non-zero, of the latest child, if present.
    Log the return (of the current node that is a parent of that child).
}
```
E.g.
```c++
    last_child() { /* Optional nested calls */ }
    // last_child() repeats 99 time(s).                 // 2. Log this.
} // parent()       // 1. The return being handled.     // 3. Log this.
```
```
Otherwise (caching is active) {
    If there exists a previous sibling of the returning function, then {
        The call subtree of the returning function is compared recursively
        to the previous sibling call subtree.
```
E.g. 
```c++
    child() {                           // 3.
        // Optional nested calls.
    }     
    // Optionally repeats.
    child() {                           // 2.
        // Optional, potentially different, nested calls.
    } // 1. The return being handled.   // 4. The subtrees 2 and 3 are compared recursively.
```
```        
        If equal {
            the previous sibling's (3) repeat count is incremented
            and the currently returning function's call subtree (2) is removed from the call graph.
            If the previous sibling (3) is the caching_model then caching is over, 
            i.e. the `caching_model` becomes `None` (Side Thought: what if we continue caching and set a cahcing flag to false?).
        }
        Otherwise (subtrees 2 and 3 differ) {
            // Caching is active, previous sibling (3) exists but differs (and potentially has the non-zero repeat count).
            // If the difference between 2 and 3 was by name 
            // then the caching start would not be detected after 3 starting with 2
            // (the previous sibling would not be the `caching_model`).
            // But the caching is active, which means that 
            // * either the caching start has been detected 
            //   at the level of a parent (of the returning function) or above, in which case we continue caching,
            // * or the difference between 2 and 3 is by nested calls, in which case the the previous sibling
            //   can be the `cahing_model`, in which case we detect the caching end.
            If the previous sibling (3) is the cahing_model then {
                Log the previous sibling's (3's) repeat count, if non-zero,
                Log the subtree of the returning function (2).
                Stop caching. `caching_model = None`
            }
            otherwise (caching has been detected at a parent level or above) {
                // Do nothing, continue caching.
            }
        } // Otherwise (subtrees 2 and 3 differ)
    } // If there exists a previous sibling (3) of the returning function (2).
    Otherwise (the returing func 2 is the only child) {
        // Continue caching, do nothing. Caching end cannot be detected upon return from the only child.
    }
} // Otherwise (caching is active)

## Consider Using `Box` instead of `Rc`
Consider Using `Box<RefCell<Node>>` instead of `Rc<RefCell<Node>>` for the 
* call graph nodes 
* and the pointer to the pseudo-node (`root`).

Everywhere else consider using refs (`&`). In particular, for the `CallGraph`'s
* `call_stack` (`Vec<&?>`),
* `current` (`&RefCell<Node>`),
* `caching_model` (`Option<&Node>`).

## Consider Logging the Parameters and Returned Values
E.g.
```c++
main() {
    f(a: 1, b: false) {
        g(c: "OK", d: [1, 2]) {} // g() returned Some(5).
    } // f() returned true.
    h(x: 1, y: 8) {} // h() returned MyEnum::MyValue.
}
```
Hint: As a result of the proc macro expansion 
* the instrumented function logs the call and params,
* invokes the body as an expression and saves the result in the local varaible,
* logs that result,
* returns that result.

E.g.
The original (instrumented) code:
```rust
#[loggable(params, ret)]
fn f(x: i32, y: i32, flag: bool) -> usize {
    if g(x, y) > 5 && flag {
        8
    } else {
        0
    }
}
```
The result of the macro expansion:
```rust
fn f(x: i32, y: i32, flag: bool) -> usize {
    log_call!(x, y, flag); // Macro. Logs the call and params: "f(x: 1, y: -3, flag: false) {".
    let ret_val = {
        // Fucntion body.
        if g(x, y) > 5 && flag {
            8
        } else {
            0
        }
    }
    log_ret_and_val!(ret_val); // Macro. Logs the return and the returned value: "} // f() returned 8."
    ret_val
}
```

# Known Issues
* (N/A after std output sync) std Output outpaces the cached log
* Logging attempt for `const` functions results in a compile error:  
  `cannot call non-const method ``..::with`` in constant functions`
* (N/A) Currently the function names in `impl` blocks are not prefixed with `MyStruct::`.

# What is Missing or Wrong in Rust

## `rust-analyzer`: Macro Expansion Fails for Closures
`rust-analyzer` (`<Ctrl+Shift+p>`, "rust-analyzer: Expand macro recursively at caret"):  
  Macro expansion for an instrumented closure shows nothing.
  ```rs
  #[loggable] // Macro expansion shows nothing.
  |x| !x      // Macro expansion shows nothing.
  ```
  But for an unstrumented function
  ```rs
  #[loggable]
  fn f() {}
  ```
  shows the macro expansion
  ```rs
  // Recursive expansion of loggable macro
  // ======================================
  
  fn f() {
      use fcl::call_log_infra::CALL_LOG_INFRA;
      let mut _l = None;
      CALL_LOG_INFRA.with(|infra| {
          if infra.borrow_mut().is_on() {
              _l = Some(CallLogger::new("f"))
          }
      });
      {}
  }  
  ```
  ### Solution
  ```ps
  cargo install cargo-expand
  # Nightly toolchain is default.
  cargo exapnd --bin consumer_bin
  ```


## `quote::quote!()`: Interpolation using the Struct Fileds is not Implemented
  ```rust
  .. = quote!{
    #mystruct.my_field // This works unexpectedly.
  }
  ```
  (the whole `#mystruct` structure is interpolated, and then `.my_field` is added verbatim)  
  The source of `quote!()` makes an impression that only a single identifier is expected after the `#`.

  # Dead Ends

  ## Using `-Zunpretty=expanded` to See the Macro Expansion
  (See solution at the end of the section)  
  [This section](https://veykril.github.io/tlborm/syntax-extensions/debugging.html#debugging)
  recommends `-Zunpretty=expanded` flag of the Rust compiler `rustc` to see the result of the macro exansion.  
  (A number of smaller dead ends aside) I ended up in the following in the PowerShell prompt of my VSCode:
  ```ps
  $env:RUSTFLAGS="-Zunpretty=expanded"
  pushd consumer_bin
  # Nightly toolchain is active/defualt.
  cargo rustc --bin consumer_bin
  ```
  This caused the following error that I failed to work around in couple of hours of reasonable time.
  ```
  error: failed to run custom build command for proc-macro2 v1.0.95
  Caused by:
  could not execute process fcl_workspace\target\debug\build\proc-macro2-f6d5a347646a87e0\build-script-build (never executed)

  Caused by:
    The system cannot find the file specified. (os error 2)
  warning: build failed, waiting for other jobs to finish...
  ```
  The reason could be the following.  
  The `proc_macro` crates are built first (to a dynamic library or a separate binary linked/invoked by the compiler at the subsequent compilation stages). The `proc_macro` crates define the procedural macros that the compiler uses during the subsequent actual compilation of the main code. In particular, during the preprocessing of the main code the compiler takes the input of procedural macro invocations, feeds that input (in the form of the `TokenStream`) to the procedural macros, gets the macro output (again `TokenStream`), inserts that output to the translation unit and passes the eventual translation unit (after the macro expansion) to the compilation stage.  
  Having the `RUSTFLAGS="-Zunpretty=expanded"` environment variable (or a `-Zunpretty=expanded` flag) the Rust compiler `rustc` does a macro expansion instead of compilation. As a result the `proc_macro` crates fail to build before the compilation of the main code. And the `proc_macro` crates binaries (or dynamic libraries) are not found by the compilation scripts while compiling the main code.

  I got a conclusion that the `-Zunpretty=expanded` is not the right tool when workgin with the procedural macros. Moreover...  
  **If you forget to remove the env var `RUSTFLAGS="-Zunpretty=expanded"` from your environent, then the subsequent cargo commands can fail with unclear reasons**. In particular `cargo install cargo-expand` will fail.

  ### Solution
  ```ps
  cargo install cargo-expand
  # Nightly toolchain is default.
  cargo exapnd --bin consumer_bin
  ```

# Scrap-Heap. Preserved for Learning Purposes and My Own Reference
## Trailing Comma After a Closure
**Has Been Fixed** (by using `ExprClosureComma`).  
  [`syn::ExprClosure`](https://docs.rs/syn/latest/syn/struct.ExprClosure.html). If a closure is passed as the last argument to a function then the VSCode's Rust Code Formatter (`<Alt+Shift+f>`) adds an optional trailing comma after a closure (Rust grammar permits the trailing comma in the list of function arguments (and [function parameters](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/functions.html?highlight=parameter#functions) in the function definition)), which causes a confusing compilation error (for an instrumented closure): `expected expression, found keyword 'fn'`.
  ```rs
  None.map(     // Closure is the last argument of `map()`.
    #[loggable] // 2. Error: expected expression, found keyword 'fn'
    |x| !x      // 1. <Alt+Shift+f> adds comma after `!x`.
  )
  ```
  The error likely happens becuase the parser for `ExprClosure` does not consume the optional trailing comma from the `TokenStream`.
  Temporary workaround - `#[rustfmt::skip]` ([details](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes.html#tool-attributes)) - for an item the closure belongs to:
  ```rs
  #[rustfmt::skip]
  None.map(
    #[loggable]
    |x| !x      // <Alt+Shift+f> does NOT add comma after `!x`.
  )
  ```
  Placing `#[rustfmt::skip]` immediately after `#[loggable]` causes the same confusing compilation error despite the fact that `syn::ExprClosure` (looks like) covers the attributes.
  ```rs
  None.map(
    #[loggable] // Error: expected expression, found keyword 'fn'
    #[rustfmt::skip]
    |x| !x
  )
  ```
  The result of macro expansion (`cargo expand --bin consumer_bin`) is 
  ```rs
  None.map((/*ERROR*/))
  ```
  Generating `#[rustfmt::skip]` as a result of a macro expansion does not help since `<Alt+Shift+f>` adds comma at edit time, before the compile time (before the result of the macro exapnsion is known).

  After the final fix placing the `#[rustfmt::skip]` immediately before or after `#[loggable]` causes compilation error `expected '|'`.
  ```rs
  #[rustfmt::skip]  // The closest right place for `#[rustfmt::skip]` (or at an enclosing item).
  None.map(
    #[loggable]
    |x| !x      // <Alt+Shift+f> does NOT add comma after `!x`.
  )
  ```
  After the fix the `#[rustfmt::skip]` is not needed. The optional trailing comma is consumed normally (at least if the closure is the last argument of a function ;-).

## Closure Naming
```rs
    // Call Graph:
    pub fn add_call(&mut self, name: &CalleeName) {
        // // Generate a name for a closure ("enclosing()::closure" or "?()::closure"):
        // let name = if func_name == "" {
        //     // Called function is a closure.
        //     // Get parent's name if present, otherwise "?":
        //     let parent_name = if self.call_stack.len() <= 1 {
        //         // pseudo (or nothing, which must never happen :)
        //         NameEither::Function(&"?")
        //     } else {
        //         self.call_stack.last().unwrap().borrow().name.clone()
        //         // match &self.call_stack.last().unwrap().borrow().name {
        //         //     // "enclosing"
        //         //     NameEither::StaticSlice(slice) => slice, // Traditional parent ;). "enclosing"
        //         //     NameEither::StdString(str) => &str, // Parent is also a closure. "enclosing()::closure"
        //         // }
        //     };
        //     NameEither::Closure(
        //         String::from(format!(CLOSURE_NAME_FORMAT!(), parent_name.get_ref()))   // "enclosing()::closure" or "enclosing()::closure()::closure()"
        //     )
        // } else {
        //     // Called function is a non-closure.
        //     NameEither::Function(func_name) // Leave as is. "enclosing"
        // };
        // let name_ref = name.get_ref();
```
## Logging the Generic Parameters
* (User practice?) Logging the generic params. Instead of `f<T>()`, log `f<char>()`, `f<int>()`, `f<MyStruct>()`, i.e. for 
  ```rs
  #[loggable]
  fn f<T>() { /*Body*/ }
  ```
  expand NOT to 
  ```rs
  fn f<T>() {
    let _logger = FunctionLogger("f<T>");
    { /*Body*/ }
  }
  ```
  but to
  ```rs
  fn f<T>() {
    let name = String::from("f<") + to_string<T>.name + ">"; // Or `to_string!(T)`
    let _logger = FunctionLogger(&name);
    { /*Body*/ }
  }

  struct to_string<T>;
  struct to_string<char> {
    const name: "char"
  }
  struct to_string<u8> {
    name: "u8"
  }
  ...

  // Or
  decl_macro! to_string {
    ($t::ty) => stringify!($t)
    // (char) => "char",
    // (u8) => "u8",
    // ...
  }
  ```
  Solution: 
  ```rs
    use std::any::type_name;

    fn f<T, U>() {
        let type_str = format!("<{}, {}>", type_name::<T>(), type_name::<U>());
        println!("{}", type_str);
    }
    f::<char, bool>();  // <char, bool>
    f::<u32, f64>();    // <u32, f64>
    struct MyStruct<T, U> { t: T, u: U }
    f::<MyStruct<f32, bool>, char>();   // <user::main::MyStruct<f32, bool>, char>    
  ```

## Done
* Closure. For a more qualified closure name `"f()::closure<..>())"` the enclosing function's name can be taken from the call stack.
* Closure name  
  Consider naming: for a closure inside of function `f()`: `"f()::closure_at_<start line number>[_<end line number>]"`, where `<end line number>` is used for multi-line closures. Or `"f()::closure{<start line number>:<column number>..<end line number>:<column number>}"`. 
* Functions
* Generic Functions (template functions).  
  Naming: `"generic<T, U>"`  
  (currently, at the prerocessing stage, unknown is the way to substitute the generic parameters (`T`, `U`) with the actual generic arguments (like `u32`, `bool`) to get the multiple concretizations of a generic function like `generic<u32, bool>`, `generic<String, usize>`).
* Closures (lambdas).  
  Where and how to get the line and column numbers? Should be something related to spans. See 
  * proc_macro2/Span/{[start()](https://docs.rs/proc-macro2/latest/proc_macro2/struct.Span.html#method.start), end()}. Can help: `[local_]file()` (source file path).
  * [proc_macro/Structs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/proc_macro/#structs)/{[Span](https://doc.rust-lang.org/proc_macro/struct.Span.html), [SourceFile](https://doc.rust-lang.org/proc_macro/struct.SourceFile.html)},
  Consider naming: for a closure inside of function `f()`: `"f()::closure_at_<start line number>[_<end line number>]"`, where `<end line number>` is used for multi-line closures. Or `"f()::closure{<start line number>:<column number>..<end line number>:<column number>}"`. 
* Local functions. The enclosing function is instrumented (and probably the local one too). Naming: `"enclosing()::nested"`.
* unsafe, async
* Trait 
  * OK. Functions (default implementations in the trait), `"Trait::TraitMethod"`
  * OK (manual naming). Implementations (of the pure virtual functions with no definition, no body), `"<MyStruct as Trait>::TraitMethod"`
  * Added separately to TODO. Overrides (overrides of the default implementation, if possible). `"<MyStruct as Trait>::TraitMethod"`
  * Tested. Pure virtual is not loggable.
    ```rs
    trait MyPureTrait {
        // #[loggable]      // Error: expected `|`
        fn pure_method(&self); // No defualt behavior. Pure virtual function with no def-n.
    }
    ```
* `#[loggable(name="MyStruct::new")]`. Assoc funcs prefix `MyStruct::`.
* Not applicable (Happens before mangling). Demangling
* Outputing to stream (stdout, stderr, file, socket/pipe, [`mcsp::channel`]).
* Multithreaded implementation.  
  To do: 
  * static `ThreadSharedWriter`, 
  Latest:  
  * Writer.  
    Commit: thread_arbiter  
    * In a single-threaded case the decorator gets `Option<Box<dyn Write>>`. If `None` then uses `stdout()`.
      Otherwise uses `Box<dyn Write>` (file, socket, etc.) directly.
    * In a multithreaded case

      * It also has `last_write_thread`.  
        If the thread context has switched (`last_write_thread` != `thread::current().id()`)
        then the `CallLoggerArbiter` invokes the `flush()` for the `last_write_thread` (`HashMap[last_write_thread].flush()`)

  Earlier:
  See a [note](https://docs.rs/proc-macro2/latest/proc_macro2/#thread-safety) (proc_macro2: Most types in this crate are `!Sync` because the underlying compiler types make use of thread-local memory).  
  Consider a similar note for "fcl" if applicable.  
  * Write the Mutithreaded code.
  * Try `#[loggable]`.
  * Design what should be.
    * Mutexed Writer.
  Have in mind:
  * Thread indent prefix.
  * [Thread log color]
  * Probably single-threaded (faster) and multi-threaded fcl.

Unsorted  
* Recursive prefix and recursive `#[loggable]` in functions. 
  * Handle function body recursively to pass `#[loggable]` to local functions and closures.
  * Same for `ImplItemFn` (associated function).
* Good compiler error reporting in case of proc_macro error.  
* Nested `#[loggable]`
* `#[non_loggable]`
* (User practice?) Enable logging globally for everything.  
  Gloobal `#![loggable]`. Log all. Also:  
  `#[loggable] impl ..`
  * Example:  
    ```rust
    #[loggable]
    impl MyStruct {
        // The `#[loggable]` above adds here `#[loggable(MyStruct::new)]`
        // unless `#[nonloggable]` is specified.
        pub fn new() -> Self {
            Self
        }
    }
    ```
  * Overall for `impl`.  
    By defualt none of the associated functions is loggable (log none).  
    `#[loggable] impl ..`: 100% of associated functions are loggable (log all).  
    Manual `#[loggable] fn ..`: for <=50% loggable (log some, "white list").  
    `#[loggable] impl ..`, manual `#[nonloggable] fn`: for >50% loggable (log all except some, "black list").
* Logging the params and return values.
* Make `#[loggable]` recursive (same for `prefix`) such as for 
  ```rs
  #[loggable(prefix=e)]
  fn f() {
    fn g() {} // Local function is defined.
    g(); // Local function is called.

    let closure = || 5; // Closure is defined
    closure(); // Closure is called.
  }
  ```
  the effect is the same as of
  ```rs
  #[loggable(prefix=e)]
  fn f() { // e::f()
    #[loggable(prefix=e::f)] // `prefix` is optional.
    fn g() {} // Local function is defined. `e::f::g()`
    g(); // Local function is called. `e::f::g()`

    let closure = 
      #[loggable(prefix=e::f)] // `prefix` is optional.
      || 5; // Closure is defined. `e::f::closure{L,C:l,c}()`
    closure(); // Closure is called. `e::f::closure{L,C:l,c}()`
  }
  ```
----
* Output outpaces the cached logging. Ideally intercept the output and flush before,
  otherwise document that.
  * +stdout and sync stderr and stdout.
  * [`gag::Hold`](https://docs.rs/gag/latest/gag/): 
    * Hold the non-fcl `print[ln]!()` output until the next fcl {output or cache update},
    * drop the `hold` before the fcl {output or cache update},
    * do the fcl {output or cache update},
    * get a new `hold`.  

    Disadvantages: 
    * During FCL caching deos not provide the expected behavior.  
      The non-fcl ouptut is held without any info about which part of the cahce the non-fcl output relates to.
      E.g. f() is called 10 times, but only the 8th call does println!(). That println!() ouptut is held, 
      and then upon flush is dropped either before or after `// f() repeats 9 time(s)`. But must be 
      `// f() repeats 6 time(s)`
      `f() {`
      `println!() output`
      `} // f()`
      `// f() repeats 2 time(s)`
    * drop the hold (and get a new hold) every time of fcl {output or cache update}  
      instead of flushing the fcl before any non-fcl output. Not good for lots of fcl output and little other output, which is expected to be the case.
    * See [Limitations](https://crates.io/crates/gag).
    * Does not work for non-fcl-code panic: the panic report is held
      ([`stderr` is held](https://docs.rs/gag/latest/gag/struct.Hold.html#method.stdout)),
      but after the panic 
      the fcl does not get control and does not drop the held panic report.  
      Can be easily worked around with `set_panic()`. Upon panic the fcl drops all its holds and flushes its data.

    Advantages:
    * Stable.
  * `std::io::set_print()`  
    Disadvantages:
    * Unstable

    Advantages:
    * Does the right thing. In particular flushes the fcl upon non-fcl output
      which is good for the expected case of lots of fcl output and little other output
      (the output synchroinization mechanism gets triggered as rarely as the non-fcl output happens).

**Chat-GPT about `std::io::set_print()`:**  
> _Is it possible for the Rust program to intercept its own output to stdout and/or stderr such that certain Rust subroutine (hook) gets control before some other part of the same Rust program outputs to stdout and/or stderr?_

Yes, in **Rust**, it is **possible** to intercept (or redirect) output to `stdout` and `stderr` so that a **hook or function** can be invoked **before** the actual output happens. This can be done through:

---

## ✅ 1. **Replacing `stdout` / `stderr` with custom writers**

You can use Rust’s I/O traits to **swap out `stdout` / `stderr`** with a custom implementation of `Write` that runs your hook logic.

### Example: Custom `Write` Wrapper

```rust
use std::io::{self, Write};
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};

struct HookedWriter<W: Write> {
    inner: W,
    hook: Arc<dyn Fn(&[u8]) + Send + Sync>,
}

impl<W: Write> Write for HookedWriter<W> {
    fn write(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> io::Result<usize> {
        (self.hook)(buf); // Call hook first
        self.inner.write(buf)
    }

    fn flush(&mut self) -> io::Result<()> {
        self.inner.flush()
    }
}
```

Then, you can redirect output using the `set_print` and `set_panic` hooks or through redirection (next section).

---

## ✅ 2. **Global redirection with `set_print` and `set_panic` (stable)**

Rust provides the ability to override the default print and panic behavior globally.

### Redirect `println!` and `print!` output:

```rust
use std::io::{self, Write};
use std::sync::Once;

static INIT: Once = Once::new();

fn main() {
    INIT.call_once(|| {
        let hook = |buf: &[u8]| {
            eprintln!("[HOOKED]: {}", String::from_utf8_lossy(buf));
        };

        let writer = HookedWriter {
            inner: io::stdout(),
            hook: Arc::new(hook),
        };

        let locked_writer = Arc::new(Mutex::new(writer));
        let cloned = locked_writer.clone();

        std::io::set_print(Some(Box::new(move |s: &str| {
            let mut w = cloned.lock().unwrap();
            w.write_all(s.as_bytes()).unwrap();
        })));
    });

    println!("Hello world"); // This goes through the hooked writer
}
```

> `std::io::set_print` is **stable since Rust 1.58**.

---

## 🧪 3. **Use crates like `duct`, `assert_cmd`, `test-case`, or capture macros**

For **testing** or **temporary redirection**, you can also use `std::io::set_output_capture` (unstable) or crates like:

* [`duct`](https://crates.io/crates/duct) for process-based I/O
* [`assert_cmd`](https://crates.io/crates/assert_cmd) to capture and test CLI output

---

## ⚠️ Notes and Limitations

* You **must set the hook before any output happens**, because `stdout()` returns a global handle that is shared across the program.
* This approach does **not** stop other code from accessing `stdout()` directly unless you globally override `print`/`println` macros.
* `eprintln!` and `panic!` go to `stderr`, which can be hooked with `std::panic::set_hook`.

---

## 🔄 To hook `stderr` (e.g., from panics):

```rust
std::panic::set_hook(Box::new(|info| {
    eprintln!("[PANIC HOOK] {}", info);
}));
```

| ----------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |

| Redirect all output globally              | ✅ (partial) | Requires global override early in main()       |
| Introspect printing from arbitrary crates | ❌           | Not directly (unless you control their I/O)    |

==============================================================
> ***Refer me to the documentation of std::io::set_print.***

The function you're looking for is **`std::io::set_print`**, which indeed exists in Rust but is **unstable** and **hidden from the stable API** (you won't find it in the official docs). It's guarded behind the `"set_stdio"` feature and was originally introduced to support test harness capture behavior ([github.com][1]).

---

### 🔍 What the docs say

In the Rust standard library source, it looks like this:

> `pub fn set_print(sink: Box<Write + Send>) -> Option<Box<Write + Send>>`

This function:

* **Replaces the thread-local stdout handle** for `print!`, `println!`, etc.
* Returns the **previous handle**, allowing you to restore it.
* Only affects output generated by the print macros (not direct `io::stdout()` usage) ([github.com][1]).

It's marked with:

* `#[unstable(feature = "set_stdio", …)]`
* `#[doc(hidden)]`

---

### ⚙️ Example usage

Here's how `set_print` might be used internally in `libtest` (the default test harness):

```rust
use std::io::{Write, set_print};

// Replace stdout for this thread
let old = std::io::set_print(Some(Box::new(my_custom_writer())));
// run code that uses println!()
// ...
// Restore original stdout
std::io::set_print(old);
```

---

### ✅ Summary

* **`std::io::set_print` exists but is unstable and hidden.**
* It allows **redirecting `println!` output** within the current thread.
* It doesn't cover **direct `io::stdout()` writes**.
* It's primarily used by the standard test harness for **capturing test output**.

---

Would you like help with a stable alternative for capturing `stdout` in your own code—perhaps using crates like `gag` or custom `Write` wrappers?

  * Move writer.rs
  * Remove traits.rs
  * Cleanup
  * Restructure to a minimal set of crates (fcl, proc_macros, commons).
* Redundancy:
  * Either create the cloure logger UNCONDITIONALLY, like function logger (regardless of whether logging is on), The ctor and dtor will check the enabledness;
  * or create both closure and function loggers conditionally and don't check the condition in the ctor and dtor.
  * In the former - less code in the func (enabledness is checked in one place - ctor), but more calls, works slower, and higher load for the stack (and heap?) because the instance is created unconditionally.  
  In the latter case - function/cloure code bloat (every function checks the enabledness) but works faster.
  * No. Looks like in the latter case we can retain the top performace when the logging is disabled, 
  since 
    * if logging is disabled then only the function body is executed (which is nearly the same perf as non-instrumented),  
    * otherwise (all at run time)
      * generic function name calculation,
      * param string calculation,
      * logger instance creation, call graph update, logging,
      * ret val string calculation and memorization
      * logger destruction, call graph update, logging,
  * To summarize:
    ```rs
    fn f() {
      if logging_disbaled {
        return <func_body>
      }
      // Else (loggign is enabled):
      generic function name calculation,
      param string calculation,
      logger instance creation, call graph update, logging,
      
      <func_body>
      
      ret val string calculation and memorization
      logger destruction, call graph update, logging,
    }
    ```
  * To do:
    * See "To summarize".
    * remove condition form the ctor and dtor
    * same for LoopbodyLogger
    * Remove the common part of LoopbodyLogger and FunctionLogger.
